Quite intelligent, ready to learn tricks and often used as guide dogs, the Golden is an active dog that likes to help and please everyone (including those he doesn t know so well). He loves tricks and needs a lot of attention and free time to spend his energy. He is also a great swimmer and a favorite of several families, something that has made his popularity very high in recent decades here in Brazil and around the world.',

        'Everyone loves having that friend who, wherever you call him, he says "let s go". In the canine world, this friend who agrees with everything exists and is called Jack Russell Terrier. The puppy of this breed does not stop for a moment, being always connected to 330v — it is not even 220v — and loves tutors with similar energy. The name Terrier conveys a lot about the characteristics of the breed. An excellent hunter, this little dog loves to investigate any hole he finds ahead and is extremely independent. When you re interested in something, you only stop after you ve conquered it. You can already see that the limit is not really your thing.',
